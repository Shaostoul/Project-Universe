# PROJECT UNIVERSE
Is a mixed reality (AR/VR/PC/Console/Mobile) massively multiplayer online (MMO) in development by Shaostoul's community that grew from his years of modding and teaching others to mod Space Engineers. On top of being a modding community we're now a game development community!

The story of the game follows humanity as it leaves our solar system for the first team with a fleet of colony ships incapable of faster than light (FTL) on a quest to colonize the many solar systems discovered to have planets capable of supporting human life.
